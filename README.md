### OpenCV Tutorial Series
 
> This porject contains OpenCV series of Tutorials, and the tutorials are being improved and updated
 
> This series of tutorials are based on my own learning and practice, May be you can find some issues. You are welcome to correct me and help me to improve. 
> This is a introudctary series, the knowledge involved is limited enough to start. There might be some articles in depth.
